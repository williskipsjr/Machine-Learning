# Dimensionality Reduction

## Overview
This lab explores dimensionality reduction techniques to reduce feature space while preserving important information. Compares multiple approaches on the MNIST dataset.

## Files
- **L05.ipynb**: Complete analysis notebook with multiple algorithms

## Techniques Covered
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Linear dimensionality reduction via variance maximization
- **t-SNE**: Non-linear manifold learning for visualization
- **MDS (Multidimensional Scaling)**: Distance-preserving embedding
- **LLE (Locally Linear Embedding)**: Local neighborhood-preserving technique

## Dataset
MNIST digit dataset (subset of 5000 samples for faster computation)

## Key Concepts
- Feature extraction and compression
- Visualization of high-dimensional data
- Trade-offs between accuracy and dimensionality
