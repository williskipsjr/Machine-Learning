# Email Spam Classifier

## Overview
This lab implements a spam email classification system using machine learning techniques. The project involves data preparation, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.

## Files
- **SpamClassifier.ipynb**: Main notebook with complete spam classification pipeline
- **prepare_data.py**: Data preprocessing and cleaning functions
- **split_train_test.py**: Train-test split utility functions
- **SpamClassifier_Procedure.txt**: Step-by-step procedure documentation

## Dataset
Uses email datasets from easy_ham, hard_ham, and spam categories for binary classification.

## Key Concepts
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Binary classification (Spam vs. Ham)
- Model evaluation metrics
