# Machine Learning – Concepts & Projects

This repository is my personal workspace for learning and experimenting with **Machine Learning concepts through hands-on coding and real datasets**. Everything here is focused on building a **strong foundation in ML**, step by step, by actually implementing what I learn.

The idea behind this repo is simple:  
**Learn the theory → write the code → break things → fix them → understand ML properly.**

## What You’ll Find Here

This repo contains:
- Implementations of **core Machine Learning algorithms**
- Practice notebooks for **important ML concepts**
- **Mini-projects and full projects** built on real datasets
- End-to-end ML workflows: from raw data to final model

Topics covered include:
- Regression & Classification
- Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Evaluation & Tuning
- Overfitting, Underfitting & Bias–Variance tradeoff

## Why This Repository Exists

I created this repository to:
- Truly **understand ML fundamentals**, not just use libraries
- Maintain a **clean record of my learning progress**
- Build a **strong project-based ML portfolio**
- Prepare for **internships, research work, and future roles in ML/AI**

This is a **learning-first repository**, so you may see multiple approaches to the same problem as my understanding improves over time.

## Tech Stack

Most of the work here is done using:
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

More advanced tools and deployment frameworks will be added as I grow.
