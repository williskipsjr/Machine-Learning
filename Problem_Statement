1. Train an SVM classifier on the wine dataset, which you can load using
sklearn.datasets.load_wine(). This dataset contains the chemical analyses of 178 wine
samples produced by 3 different cultivators: the goal is to train a classification model
capable of predicting the cultivator based on the wine’s chemical analysis. Since SVM
classifiers are binary classifiers, you will need to use one-versus-all to classify all
three classes. What accuracy can you reach?


2. Train and fine-tune an SVM regressor on the California housing dataset, which you
can load using sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing(). The targets represent
hundreds of thousands of dollars. Since there are over 20,000 instances, SVMs can be
slow, so for hyperparameter tuning you should use far fewer instances (e.g., 2,000) to
test many more hyperparameter combinations. What is your best model’s RMSE?
